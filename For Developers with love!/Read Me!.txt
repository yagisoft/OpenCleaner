We made OpenCleaner for everyone to use and for everyone to contribute. 
By editing OpenCleaner you can create different themes, 
further optimize the code, add new features and send it to us. 
This way we can make OpenCleaner the best for everyone and keep our computers free of garbage!

Anyone is free to modify, use, or compile
this software.If you want to update, modify, publish, sell or 
in any way make money on the software, please contact us before doing so.

We created OpenCleaner so that anyone can use and modify it. 
This is an open source and free alternative to our YCleaner software. 
OpenCleaner was and always will be free. For this reason,
we will not allow you to copy one or more parts of the OpenCleaner code 
or program and sell it for a fee or earn money in this way.

Having said that, you are allowed to write your own program based 
on OpenCleaner's code or the program itself. 
But please do not try to copy some or all of OpenCleaner and sell it.
