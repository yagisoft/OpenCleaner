further optimize the code, add new features and send it to us. 
This way we can make OpenCleaner the best for everyone and keep our computers free of garbage!

We created OpenCleaner so that anyone can use and modify it. 
This is an open source and free alternative to our YCleaner software. 
OpenCleaner was and always will be free. For this reason,
we will not allow you to copy one or more parts of the OpenCleaner code 
or program and sell it for a fee or earn money in this way.
